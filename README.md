# Openverse Overvue

This is a simple Vue 3 project to create an overview dashboard of the GitHub and Make blog activity for Openverse. We have four repositories across which issues and pull requests are spread and it can be daunting to understand what's going on. This project aims to improve that situation and to help new contributors integrate into Openverse's workflow.

## Setup

This project uses `volta` to manage Node versions.

```bash
volta install node
volta install pnpm@6.30.1
```

Next install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
